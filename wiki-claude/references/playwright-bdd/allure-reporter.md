## Allure Reporter

You can output test results with the **allure-playwright** reporter (not `allure-cucumberjs`). Follow the instructions below:

1. [Install Allure](https://allurereport.org/docs/install/)
2. [Install Allure-Playwright](https://allurereport.org/docs/playwright/)
3. Enable `allure-reporter` in the Playwright config:
	```js
	import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
	import { defineBddConfig } from 'playwright-bdd';
	const testDir = defineBddConfig({ /* BDD config */ });
	export default defineConfig({
	  testDir,
	  reporter: 'allure-playwright', // <- enable allure reporter
	});
	```

Now run tests as usual:

```
npx bddgen && npx playwright test
```

Example feature file:

```gherkin
Feature: Playwright Home Page

    Scenario: Check title
        Given I am on Playwright home page
        When I click link "Get started"
        Then I see in title "Installation"
```
