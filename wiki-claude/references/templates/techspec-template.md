## Executive Summary

[Provide a brief technical overview of the solution approach. Summarize the key architectural decisions and implementation strategy in 1–2 paragraphs.]

## System Architecture

### Component Overview

[Brief description of the main components and their responsibilities:

* Component names and primary functions **Be sure to list every new or modified component**
* Key relationships between components
* High-level data flow overview]

## Implementation Design

### Core Interfaces

[Define key service interfaces (≤20 lines per example):

```go
// Example interface definition
type ServiceName interface {
    MethodName(ctx context.Context, input Type) (Type, error)
}
```

]

### Data Models

[Define essential data structures:

* Core domain entities (if applicable)
* Request/response types
* Database schemas (if applicable)]

### API Endpoints

[List API endpoints if applicable:

* Method and path (e.g., `POST /api/v1/resource`)
* Brief description
* Request/response format references]

## Integration Points

[Include only if the feature requires external integrations:

* External services or APIs
* Authentication requirements
* Error handling approach]

## Testing Approach

### Unit Tests

[Describe the unit testing strategy:

* Core components to test
* Mocking requirements (external services only)
* Critical test scenarios]

### Integration Tests

[If necessary, describe integration tests:

* Components to be tested together
* Test data requirements]

## Development Sequencing

### Build Order

[Define the implementation sequence:

1. First component/feature (why first)
2. Second component/feature (dependencies)
3. Subsequent components
4. Integration and testing]

### Technical Dependencies

[List any blocking dependencies:

* Required infrastructure
* External service availability]

## Monitoring and Observability

[Define the monitoring approach using existing infrastructure:

* Metrics to expose (Prometheus format)
* Key logs and log levels
* Integration with existing Grafana dashboards]

## Technical Considerations

### Key Decisions

[Document important technical decisions:

* Chosen approach and justification
* Trade-offs considered
* Rejected alternatives and why]

### Known Risks

[Identify technical risks:

* Potential challenges
* Mitigation approaches
* Areas requiring research]

### Standards Compliance
