Cucumber is a tool that supports [Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD)](https://cucumber.io/docs/bdd/). If you're new to Behaviour-Driven Development read our [BDD introduction](https://cucumber.io/docs/bdd/) first.

## What is Cucumber?

Ok, now that you know that BDD is about discovery, collaboration and examples (and not testing), let's take a look at Cucumber.

Cucumber reads executable specifications written in plain text and validates that the software does what those specifications say. The specifications consist of multiple *examples*, or *scenarios*. For example:

```markdown
Scenario: Breaker guesses a word
  Given the Maker has chosen a word
  When the Breaker makes a guess
  Then the Maker is asked to score
```

Each scenario is a list of *steps* for Cucumber to work through. Cucumber verifies that the software conforms with the specification and generates a report indicating ✅ success or ❌ failure for each scenario.

In order for Cucumber to understand the scenarios, they must follow some basic syntax rules, called [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/).

## What is Gherkin?

Gherkin is a set of grammar rules that makes plain text structured enough for Cucumber to understand. The scenario above is written in Gherkin.

Gherkin serves multiple purposes:

- Unambiguous executable specification
- Automated testing using Cucumber
- Document how the system *actually* behaves

The Cucumber grammar exists in different flavours for many [spoken languages](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference#spoken-languages) so that your team can use the keywords in your own language.

Gherkin documents are stored in `.feature` text files and are typically versioned in source control alongside the software.

See the [Gherkin reference](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference) for more details.

## What are step definitions?

[Step definitions](https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/step-definitions) connect Gherkin steps to programming code. A step definition carries out the action that should be performed by the step. So step definitions hard-wire the specification to the implementation.

```markdown
┌────────────┐                 ┌──────────────┐                 ┌───────────┐
│   Steps    │                 │     Step     │                 │           │

└────────────┘                 └──────────────┘                 └───────────┘
```

Step definitions can be written in many programming languages. Here is an example using JavaScript:

```javascript
When('{maker} starts a game', maker => {
  maker.startGameWithWord({ word: 'whale' })
})
```
