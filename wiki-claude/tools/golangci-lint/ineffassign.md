## Limitations

This tool misses some cases because it does not consider any type information in its analysis. For example, assignments to struct fields are never marked as ineffectual. It should, however, never give any false positives.

---

## Install

```bash
go install github.com/gordonklaus/ineffassign@latest
```

---

## Usage

```bash
ineffassign ./...
```

Analyzes all packages beneath the current directory.
