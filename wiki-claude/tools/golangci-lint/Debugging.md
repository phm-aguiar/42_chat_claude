You can see a verbose output of linter by using `-v` option.

```
golangci-lint run -v
```

If you would like to see more detailed logs you can use the environment variable `GL_DEBUG`. Its value is a list of debug tags.

The existing debug tags are documented in the following file: [https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/blob/HEAD/pkg/logutils/logutils.go](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/blob/HEAD/pkg/logutils/logutils.go)

For example:

```
GL_DEBUG="loader,gocritic" golangci-lint run
```
```
GL_DEBUG="loader,env" golangci-lint run
```
